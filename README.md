# 🖥️ RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program – VSD  
**Participant: RISC-V VSD Program (India)**  

Welcome to my journey through the **SoC Tapeout Program by VSD**!  
This repository documents my **week-by-week progress**, tasks, and learnings as part of **India’s largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative**.  

---

## 📌 Program Overview  
In this program, we learn to design a **System-on-Chip (SoC)** from **basic RTL to GDSII**, using **open-source EDA tools**.  
It connects **3500+ participants across India**, empowering them to build silicon and strengthen the nation’s **semiconductor ecosystem**.

## 📅 Week 0 — Setup & Tools  

| Task   | Description                                               | Status   |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| Task 0 | 🛠️ Tools Installation — Installed Icarus Verilog, Yosys, and GTKWave | ✅ Done |

### 🌟 Key Learnings  
- Installed and verified open-source EDA tools successfully.  
- Learned about basic environment setup for RTL design and synthesis.  
- Prepared the system for upcoming **RTL → GDSII flow experiments**.
